# ðŸ˜¼ Welcome to Snowball

---

First of all, what is snowball?

* Snowball is a low-weight, statically typed, object oriented programming language with garbage collector and module system.

What are some of it's advantages?

* TODO

Here is a little demonstration to show you how snowball feels like

```rust
import System

class Vector {

    priv Number x;
    priv Number y;

    pub fn __init(x: Number, y: Number) {
        self.x, self.y = x, y;        
    }
    
    // JS equivalent: const __sum = (this, vec2) => new Vector(...)
    // overrides operator +
    pub fn __sum(vec2: Vector) -> Vector = 
        new Vector(self.x + vec2.x, self.y + vec2.y)
    
    pub fn __str() -> String {
        return "Vector(x=${self.x} y=${self.y})"
    } 
}

fn main(args: Array<String>) -> Number {
    let vec1 = new Vector(1,2)
    let vec2 = new Vector(10,22)
    
    System.print(vec1 + vec2)
    return 0
}
```
